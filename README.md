# GPT-3 Poetry Results

Here are some creative writings by GPT-3 (poetry and lyrics).

## Overview

I have used BETA GPT-3 to generate some creative writings (poetry and lyrics).

In each sample, I had requested **20 outputs**. I'm sharing this out of interest and curiosity for how GPT-3 interacts with these type of prompts.

You might notice some samples are cut-off. That's because I set a limit on the maximum number of 'tokens' it can use for one response (like a word limit), so it will truncate some of its responses.

## Samples

Here are some of my favorites (from different genres).

#### Children's Rhyme
```
It's a sunny day.
And Milky wants to play!
He looks for his ball,
but it's not in the hall.

(AI): It's not on the stairs.
It's not in the yard.
Maybe it's in the attic,
somewhere really dark.
```

#### Fantasy Tale
```
A mysterious curse sweeps the land,
and into townsfolk's hearts expand.
One broken link and night shall fall,
eternal sleep will enslave them all.

But there is hope

(AI): a prophecy is spoken,
Which tells of one who will restore the sun.
She comes with a prince and shall break the spell,
and together save the land from hell.
```

```
When I'm tappin' I'm trapped in the screen
I escape when the codebase is clean

(AI): I can write code, I can code all night
You are my code and I am your light
We're in this together from dusk 'til dawn.
We got the skill to make things run
```
